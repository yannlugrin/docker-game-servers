"""PreToolUse guard for Bash: gate commands that permission rules cannot express.

Template. Copy into a project as `.claude/hooks/bash_guard.py`, then edit only
the REGISTRY section near the bottom. Everything above it is meant to travel
between projects unchanged.

Permission patterns match a command prefix. That cannot express "a force push
however it is spelled" (`git push origin --force`), nor "safe only when a flag
is set" (`ansible-playbook site.yml --syntax-check`), because the deciding
token can sit anywhere and Claude tends to put it last.

Everything here is decided on *parsed* argv, one subcommand at a time. Matching
the raw line with regexes is unsound in both directions: `git commit -m 'fix
the --amend bug'` is not an amend, and in `ansible-playbook --syntax-check
a.yml && ansible-playbook deploy.yml` the safe half must not vouch for the
other. Only tokenizing resolves quoting; only splitting separates invocations.

A line can also hide a command inside another one. Assignments bind to what
runs next (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND=… git fetch`), wrappers run something else (`sudo
git push --force`), a shell's `-c` argument is a command line in its own right,
and a substitution or subshell is another command again (`echo $(git push
--force)`). Each is walked through to the command underneath, and every command
position found is judged — so gating a wrapper never hides what it wraps.

Decisions: **deny** what has no authorized use, **ask** for anything that
writes outward or destroys work, stay silent otherwise. Silence is not approval
— it hands the call back to the permission rules and the current permission
mode, which under `auto` or `bypassPermissions` will approve.


CHOOSING A RULE KIND
--------------------

Put the enumeration on whichever side of the tool is finite, and let the
residue land on the safe default.

*Safe by default, with a listable set of dangerous acts* — git, docker, most
CLIs you read with. Declare `rules`. They are checked **existentially**: if any
subcommand in the line is a named act, the line is gated; everything unnamed
falls through silently, which is right because most of it is harmless.

*Dangerous by default, with a small safe set* — ansible-playbook, terraform,
kubectl, deploy scripts. Declare `grants`. They are checked **universally**:
every invocation must match a proven-safe shape, closed-world, and anything
else asks. A flag you never considered can then only move a verdict toward the
prompt, never away from it.

Getting this backwards is expensive both ways. Grants for git would mean
enumerating hundreds of safe subcommands, prompting on every one you forgot.
Rules for ansible would give you nowhere to put "unless --syntax-check", since
rules only fire — they never exempt.

A tool may declare both. Rules then hold regardless of the grants: a rule can
deny an act that a grant would otherwise have waved through.


WHAT MUST LAND IN settings.json
-------------------------------

This guard only ever *gates*. It never grants, so it cannot make anything run
that the permission rules would not have run anyway. Pair it accordingly:

1.  **Allow the tool broadly; let the guard claw back.** For every tool in the
    registry, add a broad allow — `Bash(git:*)`, and one line per tool the
    project adds. Prefix rules respect word boundaries, so `Bash(git:*)` does
    not leak to `git-crypt`. This is the whole point: broad allow plus a narrow
    hook is what replaces a long, brittle allow list. A gated tool with no
    allow line is pointless — it would prompt on everything anyway, and its
    grants would never be reached.

2.  **Never write an `ask` rule for a tool the guard gates.** Rules are
    evaluated deny → ask → allow, and a matching `ask` prompts *even when a
    hook returns "allow"*. An `ask Bash(ansible-playbook:*)` therefore makes
    every carve-out impossible, including the guard's. That mistake is the
    reason this file exists — express the exception here, in a `Grant`.

3.  **Do not restate the guard's asks in settings.** A prefix rule is strictly
    weaker: `Bash(git push:*)` misses `git -C dir push`, which the guard
    catches. Two sources of truth, one of them wrong.

4.  **Do keep a short `deny` backstop for the unrecoverable acts.** A hook that
    crashes — a syntax error from an edit, a lost `+x`, a missing python3 —
    fails *open*: Claude Code logs the failure and proceeds to the permission
    rules. The guard's own try/except cannot catch that, because the module
    never loaded. Denies are prefix-weak (they miss `git push origin --force`),
    but they cost nothing and they cover the losses you cannot undo.

    This need is created by step 1. Under a narrow allow list a dead guard only
    costs extra prompts; under `Bash(git:*)` it costs an unprompted
    `git push --force`. The broad allow and the deny list are a package.

5.  **Mind the permission mode.** Under `default`, a command matching no rule
    prompts, so the guard's silence is backed by a prompt. Under `auto` or
    `bypassPermissions`, no rule means auto-approved and the guard's asks are
    the only gate left — which is exactly when the grants carry real weight.

A minimal pairing for the default registry, which carries git alone. Add one
allow line per tool the project puts in the registry:

    "permissions": {
      "allow": [
        "Bash(git:*)"
      ],
      "deny": [
        "Bash(git push --force:*)",
        "Bash(git push -f:*)",
        "Bash(git filter-branch:*)",
        "Bash(git reflog expire:*)"
      ]
    },
    "hooks": {
      "PreToolUse": [
        { "matcher": "Bash",
          "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
                       "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/bash_guard.py" } ] }
      ]
    }


CHANGING THE RULES
------------------

The registry is not ordinary code. It is the boundary the operator relies on,
so it does not move on the assistant's own judgement.

*The GIT tool is ground rules.* It is the same in every project by design, and
it encodes losses that are permanent or expensive to undo. Do not add, weaken
or remove a git rule to get past a prompt in front of you. Changing it needs a
reason specific to the project and stated out loud — "this repo has no remote,
so pushing cannot happen" is one; "the prompt was in my way" is not. If a git
rule fires and you believe it should not have, that is a case to report, not a
rule to edit.

*Every rule change is the operator's call.* Adding, modifying or deleting any
Rule, Grant, known_flag or tool — propose it, say what it would newly allow or
newly gate, and wait for the operator to agree. The one exception is creating
this file from the template at the start of a project: the operator reviews the
whole registry in a single pass then, so the initial set does not need to be
approved rule by rule.

*A surprise becomes a test.* When the operator reports that the guard did the
wrong thing — prompted on something harmless, stayed silent on something it
should have caught — the fix is not complete until CASES contains the exact
command they reported, asserting the corrected verdict. A rule change with no
reproduction case is a regression waiting to happen, and the report is the only
evidence of what the rule was actually for.


WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE
----------------------

The guard reads a command line; it does not run a shell. These are known and
accepted, listed so nobody mistakes silence for coverage.

*Substitution inside quotes, and backticks.* An unquoted `$(…)`, `<(…)` or
`(…)` is examined — the lexer hands back the parentheses as their own tokens,
which both locates the command and proves it was unquoted. Quoting defeats
that: `"$(git push --force)"` stays inside a single token, and posix tokenizing
has already discarded which quote was used, so it cannot be told from the
literal `'$(git push --force)'`. Reading either would mean gating an `echo`.
Backticks are never split out at all. Both are asserted in ENGINE_CASES so the
boundary is visible rather than assumed.

*A leader we do not recognise.* `myrunner git push --force` is silent, because
the first word is neither a registered tool, a known wrapper, nor a shell. See
UNRECOGNISED_LEADER for the knob and why the default is silence. A known
wrapper we cannot see past is a different case and always asks.

*Program text in another language.* A shell's `-c` argument is re-examined;
`python3 -c` and `node -e` are not, since reading their argument as shell would
be guesswork.

*An argument made only of separator characters.* `git commit -m "&&"` splits
where the quoted `&&` sits, because posix tokenizing has already dropped the
quotes and the token is indistinguishable from the operator. It takes a
message that is *only* punctuation, so it has not seemed worth abandoning posix
mode over — but it is real.

*Handoff option arity is approximate.* `Nested.value_opts` covers the common
options; an unknown value-taking one makes the walk lose the command being run,
which asks. That direction is deliberate: a handoff we cannot follow is
unproven, not safe. The reverse — declaring a bare flag as value-taking — is
the one that loses something, since it skips a token too many and can step over
the command itself.


KEEPING IT HONEST
-----------------

Because a broken guard fails open silently, wire `bash_guard.py --selftest`
into whatever the project runs before a commit (pre-commit, `make check`, CI).
A guard that stops working should fail the lint, not fail quietly. Add a case
to CASES for every rule you add — that is the only place the intent is written
down in an executable form.

    which is what a tool like ansible-playbook needs, having none.

    `require_any` names flags of which at least one must be *operative* — a
    token counts only if the parser saw it as a flag, so a `--syntax-check`

    `rules`
        Dangerous acts, checked existentially: any match gates the line.
        Consulted whether or not the tool is gated.

    `grants`
        Proven-safe shapes, checked universally: an invocation is silent only
        if it matches one. `None` means the tool is not gated and only `rules`
        apply; an empty tuple means gated with nothing declared safe, so every
        use asks.

    `gated_reason`
        The text shown in the permission prompt when no grant holds. It is the
        only thing read while deciding, so it should name the risk *and* the
        way to satisfy a grant ("rehearse it with --target under /tmp").
        Unused when `grants` is None.

    `known_flags`
        The closed world for a gated tool: every flag on the invocation must
        appear here, or the invocation is unproven and asks. This is not the
        tool's flag list — it is the set you have decided is safe to see, so
        leaving a flag out is how you gate it. The consequence worth keeping: a
        flag you never considered can only move a verdict toward the prompt,
        never away from it. Expect to extend this a few times early on; each
        addition should be a decision, not a reflex. Unused when not gated.

    `aliases`
        Other binary names that behave identically — `podman` for `docker`,
        `nerdctl` for both. The registry indexes the tool under each, so a
        drop-in replacement needs no second entry to keep in step.

    `nested`
        Where this tool runs another program, so the guard follows through to
        it. A wrapper is just a tool that is *only* this: `sudo` has no rules,
        it only hands off. Declaring it here rather than in a table beside the
        registry keeps a tool's option knowledge with the tool, and means
        judging the outer command never hides the inner one — both are judged,
        strongest verdict wins.

    `known_env`
        The same closed world for `FOO=bar` assignments written before the
        command. An unlisted assignment leaves a gated invocation unproven, so
        a project whose tool takes none can leave this empty and every
        assignment will prompt. Unused when the tool is not gated — a tool that
        is safe by default gates assignments through `Rule.env` instead.

    `value_flags`
        Flags that consume the following token — the tool's arity, which the
        parser cannot guess. Declaring `-i` is what makes `ansible-playbook
        deploy.yml -i --syntax-check` read as "inventory is the string
        --syntax-check", still a real deploy; undeclared, `--syntax-check`
        would look operative and the deploy would pass as a parse-only run. It
        also puts the value within reach of `Grant.flag_values`. Under-
        declaring is unsafe; over-declaring merely swallows an operand, so
        declare every value-taking flag you list in `known_flags`.

    `global_value_opts` / `global_bare_opts`
        Options accepted *before* the subcommand, stripped so that the
        subcommand path lands where `Rule.path` and `Grant.path` expect it.
        Undeclared, `git -C dir push` parses to operands ("dir", "push"), no
        rule for ("push",) matches, and the push goes ungated. `_value_` opts
        consume the next token (`-C dir`, or `--git-dir=x` in one token);
        `_bare_` opts stand alone (`--no-pager`). What separates these from
        `value_flags` is position: they are recognized only ahead of the
        subcommand, and never gate anything themselves.

# Safe by default with a listable set of dangerous acts, so `rules`. This
# project's whole development loop is docker — build, run, exec, inspect, and
# delete its own containers, images and volumes by name, which CLAUDE.md rule 9
# calls free, rebuildable working material. Only three things in that surface
# reach past the project: publishing to a registry, sweeping the whole host,
# and handing over registry credentials. Grants would mean enumerating the
# harmless majority and prompting on every subcommand not thought of.
#
# All four forms have the same shape — options, then one operand the form keeps
# for itself, then the command — and differ only in which options take a value:
#
#   run IMAGE [cmd]            spawns a container
#   compose run SERVICE [cmd]  spawns one from a compose service
#   exec CONTAINER cmd         uses a container already running
#   compose exec SERVICE cmd   same, by service
#
# What is gated is the command run *in* the container. The image or service is
# deliberately not read as a program, even when it is named after one: an image
# called `org/git` may or may not entrypoint into git, and guessing from the
# name would gate `docker run org/rm -rf` as an `rm` on the host.
#
# Only genuinely value-taking options are listed — over-declaring one would
# skip a token too many and could step over the command itself.
#
# A command inside a container is not always the host's: `docker run --rm
# alpine git push` cannot reach this repo, while `-v $(pwd):/r` can. The guard
# cannot tell those apart, and gates both.

# --- rm: dangerous by default, with one proven-safe shape ------------------
# The other way round from git and docker, because here the *safe* side is the
# finite one. Root DECISIONS.md D-004 puts every disposable artifact — bind
# mount roots, downloaded game and steamcmd content, hand-run container state —
# under `.local/`, gitignored and rebuildable from nothing. That is the only
# place where deleting is routine; everything else is the working tree, the git
# database, or another project on this host. So `grants`: a delete under
# `.local/` is silent, anything else asks. Enumerating dangerous `rm` shapes
# instead would mean guessing every spelling of a path that leaves.
#
# The old guard drew this same boundary from the other side, with a settings
# pattern `Bash(rm -rf .local/*)` plus a hook rule refusing `..`. That pattern
# matched `rm -rf .local/../../other-project` — its prefix was intact — which
# is the whole reason the `..` rule had to exist. `under` resolves the path
# before comparing, so the traversal is simply not one of the granted shapes
# and no separate rule is needed.
#
# Known limits, both costing a prompt rather than silence: an absolute path to
# this same directory asks, since the guard cannot know where the clone lives
# without hard-coding it; and `rm -rf .local/*` asks, because an unexpanded
# glob is not a plain word (the engine's VALUE_OK) and the guard never sees
# what the shell would expand it to. `rm -rf .local` and named paths under it
# are granted.

# rule should never break a test about newline handling.
#
# It declares everything the engine can express, so nothing is tested by
# accident: rules and grants together, a deny and an ask on the same path, a
# value-taking flag, a closed-world flag set. Its shape is modelled on a deploy
# tool that is dangerous by default and safe only when it parses instead of
