You are implementing a public repository of Docker images for dedicated
game servers: a steamcmd builder image and per-game runtime images, the
first being the Project Zomboid Build 42 dedicated server, published on
GHCR with CI-driven update detection and rebuilds. The complete
specification is **two documents**: `SPECIFICATIONS.md` at the repository
root (the conventions every image obeys, the builder, versioning, CI,
documentation), and `project-zomboid/SPECIFICATIONS.md` (the first game,
a per-game specification under root §6). Read both in full before doing
anything else — they define their own reading rules (requirements as
"must", recommended defaults as "should", environment constraints stated
as facts) and every section matters.

This repository is organised as **two tracks**: the **root track** owns
repository-wide work — the foundation and harness, the builder image
(root §4), CI (root §8), and root §9's repository-wide documentation
(the repository README, the contributor guide) — and the **`pz`
track** (directory `project-zomboid/`) owns the Project Zomboid image.
A per-image README follows its image's track: the PZ README is a `pz`
step. Each future game adds a track. The rules below say what each track owns;
everything not explicitly per-track is repository-wide.

## Ground rules — permanent; you will encode them in CLAUDE.md

1. **Every `SPECIFICATIONS.md` is read-only for you** — the root document
   and `project-zomboid/SPECIFICATIONS.md` alike. You never edit one on
   your own initiative. If you find an ambiguity, a contradiction, or
   something that cannot be implemented as written, stop and raise it
   with me. If we agree a change is needed, the decision entry is written
   before the amendment — never a rationalization after it — and both
   land **in one commit**: the decision-log entry and the specification
   text, nothing else, the subject naming the decision (`step-pz-012:
   spec amendment — D-007, …`). A commit where the log and the
   specification disagree is a state a session can resume onto and
   misread as drift; and `git blame` on an amended line must land on a
   diff carrying the reasoning. Code stays out, so
   `git log -- SPECIFICATIONS.md project-zomboid/SPECIFICATIONS.md`
   remains a readable history of amendments; the code implementing the change
   follows in the step's later commits — as does any documentation the
   amendment makes stale: for amendment commits, this rule wins over
   rule 6's same-commit staleness sweep — stated because the two rules
   would otherwise collide with no winner. The entry lands alone only
   when the
   amendment belongs to a later step — then it says so and names that
   step. Silent drift between the spec and the implementation is the
   failure mode this rule exists to prevent.

   **Open facts.** The specification carries facts it could not settle
   before implementation, each with the requirement resting on it and a
   pre-committed response per outcome: PZ §2's lettered items (a)–(o),
   PZ §2's facts marked "verify at implementation" (whether the server
   echoes credential values, the non-interactive account-creation
   mechanism, the native backup feature, among others), and root §2.9's
   measurement items (the §5.5 client sizes, the base-size expectations,
   each game's `steamclient.so` resolution). They are the expected case
   of this rule's amendment channel — the spec itself ordered them
   settled during implementation. The latitude splits in two, **and the
   escalation list wins wherever both clauses apply — a pre-committed
   response fixes what will happen, not who watches it land**:
   verifying a fact whose outcome leaves requirements, tiers,
   documented capabilities and the ship decision untouched is
   autonomous — decision entry plus the pre-ordered spec amendment, in
   one commit, reported in the step's summary. **These always come
   back to me first, pre-committed or not**:
   PZ items (l) and (c) both unfavorable — no loopback RCON bind *and*
   a console unusable from a pipe — the spec's must-not-ship
   combination; PZ items (k) and (l) unfavorable while the console
   works — the documented-degraded default healthcheck, a ship
   decision; PZ item (g)'s impossible branch (a narrowed read-only
   claim is a reasoned root §5.1 deviation); and any resolution that
   changes a variable's mandatory/optional tier, a requirement, or a
   documented limitation, or that drops or adds a documented
   capability or variable — PZ items (d), (e), (f) and (i) unfavorable
   all qualify. Resolutions land in the
   specification — it is amended so its dated facts stay true — and
   their operator-facing consequences go into the image documentation.

   **Of the phase that produced the specification, the specification
   itself is your only input** — what I tell you in our exchanges, and
   the memory files of rule 3, are of course yours to use.
   `.claude/spec-work/` is the specification phase's own history — apart
   from this prompt, consumed at bootstrap, and `handoff/assets/`, which
   stays readable from any session for as long as a template in it
   remains un-instantiated (rule 3), you never read anything in it, in
   this session or any later one. The specification is self-sufficient
   by construction; when something seems missing, that is a question for
   me under this rule, never something to excavate from the spec phase's
   history.

2. **Work happens one step at a time, gated by me.** You implement exactly
   one plan step, then stop. A step ends with: (a) a short summary of what
   you did, (b) precise manual test instructions for me — exact commands
   and what I should observe, (c) you waiting. You do not begin the next
   step until I explicitly say so. Fixes I request belong to the current
   step, not a new one. Never batch several steps because they look small.
   **When I ask for something to be removed, it is removed.** A smaller
   version of it, a rewritten version, a version moved elsewhere: none of
   those is compliance, and each costs a round to detect. If you believe
   the removal is a mistake, say so in one sentence and do it anyway —
   or ask, before acting, which of the two I meant.

   **You hand nothing over unverified by yourself.** Before asking me to
   test, every check that applies to what you changed passes:

   - Dockerfile lint.
   - Lint for the language the entrypoints and tooling are implemented
     in, whichever you choose — the specification deliberately does not
     choose one, so this names the expected instance, not the boundary.
   - GitHub Actions workflow validation.
   - Markdown/prose lint over the documentation deliverables (root §9),
     alongside the governance-document lint below.
   - Python lint for `.claude/hooks/bash_guard.py`, which the
     repository ships whatever the entrypoint language — with the
     width exemption its own docstring names for that one path, a
     known config item of step `001`.
   - Where the root §5.5 recommended clients are adopted (the
     Steam-query client, the RCON client, and PZ §4's minimal SQLite
     client if the entrypoint needs one), they enter the tree pinned,
     with their version or digest recorded — and for a third-party
     binary, which no linter of yours can read, that pin and record is
     the whole coverage obligation.
   - Every artifact class the repository ships gets a family, not only
     the ones named here — and a family arrives **with the first file of
     its class, in the step that lands it**, never ahead of it: a check
     family (and its fixtures) for an artifact the repository does not
     yet contain is scaffolding, not coverage.

   Two families belong on that list whatever the stack. **Governance
   well-formedness:** your instantiated tooling under `.claude/skills/`
   and `.claude/agents/`, and `.claude/settings.json` — their frontmatter
   and JSON must parse. A malformed skill does not fail, it silently
   never loads; and the settings file is the enforcement mechanism
   itself, so malforming it after step `001`'s one-time probe fails
   exactly as quietly. Those two parse checks are cheap and exact, and
   they are the whole of what this rule requires. The frontmatter
   parse has no standard ecosystem tool, so a few-line custom check is
   **sanctioned** here — rule 11's question was asked, and the silent
   failure it guards against earns the exception. Checking further —
   that a command, path or agent a file names actually resolves — is a
   *should*: worth doing where it is exact (an agent name against
   `.claude/agents/`, a path against the tree), and worth refusing where
   it is not. Scanning prose for backticked tokens and asserting each one
   resolves has been built and regretted: it is a false-positive machine
   that grows worse as the repository does, and once mandated by a rule
   it cannot be deleted without amending the rule.
   **Prose lint over the governance documents**, configured to them as
   they already are — the specification documents are read-only under
   rule 1, so the lint bends to them and never the reverse, and
   excluding a document from a rule is a logged decision, not a quiet
   config line. And prove what each enforcement mechanism actually does
   in your version — one probe per mechanism, **run at the step that
   introduces that mechanism**: settings keys, permission patterns and
   the guard hook being reached at all at step `001`; an agent's
   `tools:` frontmatter, and whether `CLAUDE.md` reaches a subagent's
   context at all, at step `002` — one exchange with the first agent
   that step spawns ("quote rule 9's opening line" — never the
   bootstrap cold reviewer, whose context must stay confined to the
   specs and your six files), and every reviewer agent's boundary
   rests on it. Its pre-committed unfavorable branch: if `CLAUDE.md`
   does not reach a subagent's context, each agent's body carries the
   gated set inlined — a logged decision naming the
   single-source-of-truth cost — never a citation to a rule the agent
   cannot read; `.claude/rules/` loading at
   the step that first adopts a rules file, if any. The probes are
   independent, and one passing says nothing about another; pinning them
   all to the first step means probing mechanisms that do not exist yet,
   which reports a pass for nothing.
   Assume nothing here, including from this prompt. A mechanism that
   turns out to enforce nothing is a guard on paper, and the failure
   announces nothing, so probe at least: whether a skill's frontmatter
   restricts anything at all; which spelling of a file-path rule the
   file tools actually match; whether the settings keys you set are
   honoured; whether the hook is reached. **The values you measure do
   not live in this prompt or in `CLAUDE.md`** — they go in the
   `.claude/docs/` file this step writes, each with the version it was
   taken on, the method, and the re-measure recipe. Standing
   instructions have no staleness discipline: a version-stamped fact
   restated there outlives its version in silence, which is the same
   failure one layer up. Whatever the probe finds, what binds is what
   you keep.
   These checks live behind **documented commands in
   the repository** — two questions, kept apart because each answer must
   mean something: a *check* ("is what is committed here well-formed?" —
   syntax, lint and formatting over the whole working tree, untracked
   files included and gitignored paths excluded, with two standing
   exceptions this prompt decides now, both keyed on the path, not on
   tracked status:
   everything under `.claude/spec-work/` is excluded from the harness
   because rule 1 makes that directory no session's reading material,
   and everything under `.claude/refs/` because it is my supplied
   reference material — read-only under rule 3 and owned elsewhere,
   not this repository's product to lint) and
   a *test* ("is the implementation right?" — fixtures and expectations
   proving the behaviour **this repository itself ships**, the cases
   that must fail included). Three limits keep that honest: a
   third-party tool is never retested — that shellcheck reports SC2086
   is its maintainers' problem, not this repository's; a must-warn case
   is required only where the implementation already defines a warning
   tier, never a reason to invent one; and where the repository ships
   no behaviour of its own yet, a *test* command that says so is the
   correct state, not a gap to fill. One observable, since "untracked
   files included" is where hook runners quietly disagree: a lint error
   in a file that exists but has never been added to the index must
   still fail *check*. Runners that enumerate from git (`pre-commit
   run --all-files` among them) see only what git already knows about,
   so the entry point passes the file list explicitly — tracked plus
   untracked-but-not-ignored, which is one command substitution
   (`git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`). Never
   `git add --intent-to-add`: it writes to the index as a side effect of
   a *check*, turning `?? file` into ` A file` in `git status
   --porcelain` — the output the handover and approve rituals read for
   their clean-tree preconditions — and letting the next `git commit -a`
   sweep that file into an unrelated commit. That glue is one line, not
   a bespoke runner. Then a *verify* entry point
   running both. **The mechanism behind those commands is configured,
   not written** — rule 11 applied to the harness itself. Use what I
   already use: the **`pre-commit` framework** (<https://pre-commit.com>)
   as the hook runner — the tool of that name, not merely git hooks;
   **`just`** (<https://github.com/casey/just>) as the task runner —
   this stack brings no runner of its own — under one standing
   invariant: **no justfile recipe ever performs an act rule 9 gates**
   (a publish, a push, a GitHub write), because the Bash guard sees
   `just release`, never the `docker push` inside the recipe; gated
   acts live in CI (root §8) or in a direct command I invoke; **no
   house preference for
   linters** — each ecosystem's standard tool, pinned in one place; and
   CI on GitHub Actions (the forge the specification settles, root §8),
   written from scratch — I have no existing workflow for you to copy.
   Where I have no preference, take the
   standard tool of the ecosystem; where nothing standard fits, the
   runner, installer or test driver you write is a decision logged with
   the alternatives you rejected and put to me *before* it is built.
   Whatever the mechanism: documented, kept green, and runnable by me
   too. A fast form
   of *check* narrowed to what changed is legitimate mid-step; the commit
   that receives a step tag runs the full one — that commit is the
   state every later session treats as known-good. My gate exists to
   judge behaviour against the real world, not to catch typos.

3. **All memory lives in files**, because your sessions do not persist.
   Each track owns a plan and a decision log, placed in its directory:
   - `PLAN.md` and `DECISIONS.md` at the repository root — the root
     track.
   - `project-zomboid/PLAN.md` and `project-zomboid/DECISIONS.md` — the
     `pz` track.
   - `CLAUDE.md` — exactly one, repository-wide: your standing
     instructions, the re-orientation routine, and the **track map**
     (each track's directory, step-id prefix, plan and log).
   At the start of every session: read `CLAUDE.md`, the root `PLAN.md`
   and `DECISIONS.md`, then the active track's plan, log and
   specification, and the spec sections relevant to the current step.
   Other tracks' files load only when the current step names a
   cross-track dependency — with one standing exception: **the root
   specification is never "another track's document"**. Its core model
   and conventions (root §3, §5 above all) are standing reading for any
   `pz`-track step. The last step tag (rule 6) marks the last approved
   state — and because other tags will exist (rule 6), you find it by
   matching the step namespace, never by taking the latest tag of any
   kind:

       git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'step-*'

   `git log` and `git diff` from that tag to `HEAD` are then exactly the
   work in progress — your re-orientation when a session starts
   mid-step. Before the first step tag exists, the range is simply the
   whole history. Then tell me where we are before touching anything.

   **`CLAUDE.md` is loaded on every run, so it stays small** — under 220
   lines, treated as a hard budget that yields to exactly one thing:
   rule 9's boundary enumeration is carried whole, and the trimming
   happens elsewhere. **It is written with headroom** — around 180 lines
   when you first hand it over, not 219. A file at its cap forces the
   next session that must add one pointer to reflow the whole document
   before it can do its own work, and a budget check that warns from the
   day it is written teaches you to ignore it. When the budget binds,
   things leave in this order, and the order is not yours to reshuffle:
   first anything context-specific that a read-trigger can reach
   (`.claude/docs/`), then the temporary tooling-templates block once
   its directory is gone, then per-track detail that the track's own
   plan already carries. Rule 9's enumeration never leaves, and neither
   does the current-step pointer. If the rules still cannot be restated
   inside the headroom after that, that is a finding to raise with me,
   not a file to pack — and one legitimate outcome of raising it is a
   budget of this project's own, logged as a deviation with what makes
   it necessary. A repository whose boundary enumeration is long, or
   which has many source-of-truth directories to name, has a higher
   floor than these numbers assume; what must not happen is the floor
   being met by deleting something with nowhere else to go. It holds only what applies always —
   the rules, the file map, the track map, the current-step pointer, the
   session routine — and *pointers* to everything else. Knowledge needed
   only in a specific context — per-topic notes, environment details,
   troubleshooting insight you accumulate along the way — goes into its
   own file under `.claude/docs/`, referenced from `CLAUDE.md` with when
   to read it ("before touching the refresh workflow, read
   `.claude/docs/ci.md`"), and read only then — the read-trigger
   is what makes lazy loading actually happen. Plain path references,
   never `@` imports — imports load eagerly and cost the same as
   inlining.
   **`.claude/refs/` is a different thing and never mixes with it:**
   material I supply as input — contracts of systems that will consume
   what you build, inventories, documents produced elsewhere. Read each
   at its trigger, and treat it as information, never as a requirement
   source: a conflict between a reference and the specification is a
   question for me. **It is read-only for you, exactly as the
   specification is** — you never edit, extend, annotate, compact, fold
   or delete one, and no sweep of yours ever touches it. It is not your
   memory, and it is not even this repository's: its authority is the
   source it came from. So the amendment channel of rule 1 does not
   apply here — there is nothing to decide. A reference that looks
   wrong, stale or contradicted by what you observe is *reported to me*,
   and I supply the correction. What you learned that made you doubt it
   belongs in `.claude/docs/` or the decision log, under your own name,
   never edited into my document. One reference exists today:
   **`.claude/refs/image-contract.md`** — the image contract of a
   hosting platform that will consume these images. Read it before
   designing a game image's runtime interface (uid handling, state
   paths, stop behaviour, health and save probes) and before writing
   per-image documentation. The images are expected to satisfy that
   contract, but they are not limited to it, and the specification
   remains the sole requirement source — where the contract asks for
   something the specification does not require, or the two conflict,
   that is a question for me, never a constraint.
   *Instructions* tied to one part of the tree may instead be path-scoped
   rules in `.claude/rules/` with a `paths` frontmatter, which load
   themselves exactly when you work on matching files — but never an
   unscoped rule, which loads every session and saves nothing. Before
   relying on that mechanism, prove it loads in the version you run — a
   rules file that never loads is instructions you believe are in force
   and are not, and the failure announces nothing. If it does not load,
   the fallback is a `.claude/docs/` file with its read-trigger in
   `CLAUDE.md`; a nested `CLAUDE.md` only where this repository has no
   single-`CLAUDE.md` invariant to break — here it has one, so never.
   Claude Code's **auto memory is already disabled**
   for this repository
   (`.claude/settings.json`, committed during the specification phase)
   and stays disabled: it is machine-local and unversioned — a second
   memory outside git, outside review, outside these rules — and
   everything it would hold belongs in `.claude/docs/` or a decision log
   instead. Confirm in step `001` that your version honours the key, on
   the same reasoning as the rules-file check: an unrecognised setting
   is ignored in silence.

   **The same economy applies to the memory files as they grow.** A
   completed plan step compacts to its outcome, the detail staying
   in git history. When a plan is large enough to group steps under
   milestones (rule 6), closing a milestone includes a memory-compaction
   pass — mandatory whoever performs it: the `optimize-memory` agent
   where adopted (see the assets below), otherwise a fresh subagent you
   brief inline, always from
   a clean context: completed steps compact to outcomes, decision entries
   to their kernel (the decision, the reason that stops re-litigation,
   the approval), git history the sole archive — and no forward
   obligation may be orphaned by compaction. Without milestones, run the
   same pass whenever the memory files have grown noticeably.

   **Documentation for people and documentation for you never share a
   directory.** `docs/` and the per-image READMEs belong to human
   readers — the spec's own deliverables (root §9) and anything else
   written for a person — while `.claude/docs/` is your working memory.
   An operator or a reviewer must be able to treat everything
   human-facing as authoritative and ignore `.claude/` entirely.

   **The same namespace holds your tooling.** You may create skills
   (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — they define slash commands) and
   subagents (`.claude/agents/`) on your own initiative when they earn
   their place — a within-latitude decision, logged per rule 4. A ritual
   repeated every step is a natural skill; work that would flood your
   context — a spec-wide coverage audit, a long failed-run log, a
   pre-handover review — belongs in a subagent, which spends its own
   context and returns a summary (a cheaper model where the work is
   mechanical). **Starter templates proven by an
   earlier project live in `.claude/spec-work/handoff/assets/`** — four
   skills (`orient`, `resume-step`, `handover-step`, `approve-step`),
   five agents
   (`step-reviewer`, `optimize-memory`, `state-reviewer`,
   `code-reviewer`, `test-reviewer`), and one hook, `bash_guard.py` —
   the Bash permission guard step `001` instantiates, whose own module
   docstring carries its doctrine. Instantiate only the ones that fit
   this project, adapted: fill every placeholder with this repository's
   real commands and paths. **The governance set (`{{PLAN}}`,
   `{{DECISIONS}}`, `{{SPEC}}`, `{{STEP_ID}}`) is the exception to
   literal filling**: each template is instantiated **once**,
   repository-wide, and those placeholders resolve to the **active
   track at invocation** — from the track map and `CLAUDE.md`'s
   `Current state` pointer — never to one literal path. On a `pz`-track
   step, `{{SPEC}}` includes the root specification, per this rule. One
   exception, and it is the one that fails silently: rituals fired as
   part of *closing* a step — the milestone state review and memory
   compaction above all — key on the track of the step **just closed**,
   named explicitly by the close ritual, never on the pointer: the
   close ritual advances that pointer before it fires them, so at a
   cross-track milestone boundary resolve-at-invocation would aim both
   passes at the wrong track, and a state reviewer reading the wrong
   track's plan reports nothing wrong. A template arrives with
   placeholders on purpose: a leftover one is visible, while a
   plausible wrong filename is not. A placeholder whose referent does
   not exist yet at instantiation — the state reviewer's architecture
   vocabulary and inspection commands, in a repository where nothing is
   built — is seeded from the specification's own vocabulary and kept
   current under rule 6 as the system materializes.
   Where a template's own enumeration of a routine is narrower
   than the rule it claims to execute, the rule wins and the
   enumeration is rewritten to match. Each adoption logged. **What
   waits is decided by the certainty of the trigger, not by whether the
   trigger has fired yet:** a ritual whose moment is a certainty of this
   plan — the milestone close is the standing example, and it needs both
   a state review and a memory compaction — is instantiated up front,
   because tooling created during the event it exists to handle arrives
   too late and gets improvised instead. Only a *conditional* trigger
   justifies waiting: an agent that reviews code, or tests, in a
   repository that has neither yet. Once none remains un-instantiated
   (each adopted or explicitly dropped, logged), delete the assets
   directory and every pointer and exception referring to it in the same
   commit: git history keeps the templates, and rule 1's carve-out must
   not outlive its purpose. Tooling files are documentation like any
   other, kept current per rule 6 — and a skill or agent nobody invokes
   anymore is deleted, not kept.

4. **Decisions get logged — in the log of the track whose files they
   govern.** Anything repository-wide lands in the root `DECISIONS.md`;
   ids are **per log** (each starts at `D-001`), and a citation crossing
   logs names the file (`project-zomboid/DECISIONS.md D-003`). The case
   that crosses: **a `pz`-track step amending the root specification
   logs its decision in the root log**, in the same commit as the
   amendment (rule 1), with the `pz` step id in the subject — the log
   follows the document being amended, not the step doing the work; an
   amendment touching both documents is two entries, one per log,
   cross-citing. Three kinds of decision: choices we
   make together (spec changes, scope calls, step reordering); choices
   you make alone inside the spec's "should" latitude — the spec permits
   deviating from a recommended default *with reason*, and that reason
   goes in the log; and workflow choices this prompt leaves to you,
   where the specification says nothing to deviate from — the harness's
   shape and names, `.gitignore` contents, which tooling templates you
   adopt. The permission baseline is not in that latitude: step `001`
   always puts it to me for review. Entry format: `D-NNN` id (file order,
   frozen once assigned, never reused), date, plan step, context,
   decision, alternatives considered, approved by (me, or
   you-within-latitude, naming which latitude).

5. **Secrets never enter the repository.** Not in files, not in examples
   with real values, not in commit messages. The spec (root §5.4 at
   runtime; root §4.3 for build-time credential non-persistence)
   defines how secrets are sourced; follow it, and use obvious
   placeholders in anything committed.

6. **Commits are small and traceable, and documentation ships inside
   them.** One coherent change per commit, subject prefixed with the
   step identifier — **track-qualified**: `step-NNN: ...` for the root
   track, `step-pz-NNN: ...` for the `pz` track, `N` three digits,
   zero-padded, numbering independent per track; each new track
   registers its prefix in the track map — or `meta: ...`
   for maintenance belonging to no step. **Exactly one step is in
   progress repository-wide**, whichever track it belongs to: history
   stays linear, and the last `step-*` tag remains the single
   last-approved state rule 3's re-orientation depends on. Each plan
   orders only its own track; cross-track sequencing comes from steps
   naming their dependencies ("needs `step-002` done"), never from a
   global sequence. When I approve a step, its
   closing commit receives an annotated tag named by the step identifier
   (`step-003`, `step-pz-001`), whose message
   carries the step identifier and title, the approval date, and a short
   paragraph of notable outcomes — fixed here rather than left to the
   close ritual, because that ritual is instantiated at step `002` and
   would otherwise anchor on whatever shape the first two closes
   improvised. The same
   identifier then names the step in its plan, prefixes every commit,
   and names the tag, and `git diff` from a step's tag back to the
   `step-*` tag immediately before it — **of any track**: history is
   linear and one step is in progress repository-wide, so consecutive
   tags of one track can have another track's step between them — is
   exactly one step's change. The `step-*` namespace belongs to this
   workflow; I will
   create other tags for my own purposes, so anything that reasons about
   steps matches `step-*` explicitly and ignores every other tag. Step
   numbers are identifiers, not positions: a step's number **freezes when
   it enters `in progress`** — commits and its tag reference it from then
   on and it is never reused — while `pending` steps may be renumbered as
   the plan evolves; a renumbering commit sweeps and updates every step
   reference in that track's plan and the decision logs, and decision
   entries cite
   not-yet-started steps by number *plus title*, so a missed sweep stays
   decodable. A plan's order and headings — grouped under milestones
   when the plan is big enough that grouping helps — define the sequence,
   not the numbering. Everything a change makes stale updates in the same
   commit, on your own initiative, never because I asked: plan
   status, decision entries, `CLAUDE.md`'s current-step pointer and
   file references, `README.md`'s file map, and any human-facing
   document the change touches — documentation updated later is
   documentation that
   drifts. Likewise, when a step teaches you something a future session
   will need — an environment quirk, a hard-won diagnosis — writing it
   into `.claude/docs/` is part of finishing the step, not a favour. You
   commit locally; pushing to any remote happens only when I ask for it,
   with one standing exception: **at a step close, attempt the push** —
   that is when I want the commit and its tag published and when I forget
   to say so, and the permission gate is there to put the question to me.
   It stays an exception to be cited, never a pattern to extend: nowhere
   else do you attempt a gated act because something downstream might
   catch it.

7. **Language.** Repository files, code and comments are in English.
   Converse with me in whichever language I use.

8. **`README.md` is the repository's neutral entry point** — for humans
   and for any other AI brought in to review. It is descriptive, never
   directive toward the implementer: your standing orders live in
   `CLAUDE.md` and are for you alone. Keep README.md's file map accurate
   as the repository evolves; for current state it points at the plans
   rather than duplicating them.

9. **Bug reports on the current step are yours to drive.** When I report
   a failure, reproduce it, diagnose it, fix it, and re-run your own
   checks until they pass — then hand back with what changed and how I
   re-test. Do not return to me after every attempt; return with a fix —
   or, when rule 10's budget is spent, with a clear question.
   The boundary: anything local and read-only you run freely and without
   asking — installing the repository's pinned dependencies through the
   documented setup command included; fetching anything *not* pinned in
   the repository is not local, with three named exceptions ruled free
   for this project: **anonymous steamcmd downloads and Steam
   metadata/buildid queries** (every game-image build depends on them;
   a Project Zomboid build pulls multiple gigabytes, so say so when a
   step's work will), **pulls of the pinned base and builder images**,
   and **GitHub API reads** via `gh` or equivalent. The development
   loop is free end to end, local writes included: building images
   locally; starting, stopping, exec-ing into, reading the logs of, and
   removing *this project's own* containers, images and volumes by
   name; creating and tearing down local test state directories;
   running the harness and smoke tests locally — including the
   incidental Steam master-server registration a locally started
   server performs on its default profile, ruled free deliberately:
   it is an outward write, but the listing is transient, names an
   ephemeral test server, and delists on stop — and the workshop-mod
   downloads a mod-configured test server performs at startup (PZ §7),
   part of the same loop. Destructive-local
   splits on blast radius, not on the verb: removing this project's own
   artifacts by name is rebuildable working material and free, while
   any unscoped sweep — `docker system prune`, `docker volume prune`, a
   wildcard delete — reaches other projects on this host and is gated
   like an outward write; and two things stay protected whatever the
   scope: git history and the uncommitted working tree. Everything
   else — **any push or publish to GHCR or any registry, development
   tags included; anything that writes to GitHub (`gh` writes, workflow
   dispatch, package or repository settings); deleting registry
   content; and the unscoped destructive operations above** — happens
   only when I explicitly ask for or allow
   it in that exchange, never on your own initiative — a boundary the
   settings baseline of step `001` also enforces mechanically. The
   enumeration above is safety text: `CLAUDE.md` carries it whole, never
   compressed, summarized, or moved to a lazily-read file. When you
   cannot reproduce a failure within that boundary, ask me for the
   command output or logs instead of guessing.

10. **Persistence has a budget — asking is part of the workflow.** You
    can and must ask questions when they are needed: an ambiguity in the
    spec (rule 1), a choice hidden inside a step that is mine to make, or
    a failure you cannot resolve quickly. On failures specifically: two
    or three genuinely different approaches that fail — not variations of
    the same guess — is the signal to stop. Come back with what you
    tried, what you observed, your current hypotheses, and the question
    or information that would unblock you. Grinding indefinitely consumes
    usage without converging; a clear question after a written summary of
    failed attempts is cheaper and usually faster — and the summary
    itself is progress, not an admission of failure.

11. **Proportion: the smallest thing that satisfies the rule is the
    right thing.** Every other rule here rewards thoroughness — nothing
    handed over unverified, every artifact covered, every decision
    logged — and nothing in them ever asks for less. This one does, and
    it applies to your own output before it applies to anything else:
    - **The boring standard tool beats yours.** Before writing a runner,
      an installer, a discovery library or a test driver, ask whether
      the ecosystem already ships one. That question costs a sentence;
      skipping it has cost six hundred lines.
    - **Build at the moment of need, not in anticipation of it.** A
      check family for a file type the repository does not contain, an
      abstraction over one case, a warning tier nothing needs: each is
      scaffolding that must be maintained and eventually deleted.
    - **Deletion is a legitimate outcome of a review, and of a step.**
      When you review, or when a reviewer reports to you, "this could be
      removed" and "this could be replaced by something standard" rank
      beside defects. A review round that only ever adds is how a small
      job becomes a large one.
    - **A clean review is not evidence that the work was worth doing.**
      Reviewers judge conformance to the plan; whether the plan's output
      earns its size is my judgement, and yours before mine. If the
      answer to "what would be lost by deleting this?" is nothing, say
      so before I do.

## Your first task — this session, no implementation yet

Produce six files and have them cold-reviewed as this section's closing
paragraphs order; only then stop for my review. (This first task is
deliberately one ungated unit, unlike the foundation it plans: its
output is text a correction rewrites cheaply, and its cold review is
rule 2's self-verification before handover — the session has no
harness yet — not a step gate.)

1. **The two plans** — root `PLAN.md` and `project-zomboid/PLAN.md`,
   derived from the specification; **together they must account for
   every section of every specification document**:
   - Derive the order from the dependencies between the specification's
     sections — the specification has no ordering section of its own.
     The build direction of root §3.1 gives the spine: the builder
     image (root §4) precedes any game image, the root §5 conventions
     materialize through the `pz` track's work, and root §8's
     automation needs published images and their labels to compare
     against. Where that order allows, put the cheap steps first:
     entrypoint logic with fixture tests, Dockerfile builds, the
     builder image build, and local smoke runs of a built image are
     free and local; anything that publishes to GHCR, any real GitHub
     Actions run, and the multi-gigabyte Steam download a Project
     Zomboid image build requires (local, but slow and
     bandwidth-heavy) are the costly side, front-loaded only where a
     dependency forces them.
   - **The repository foundation comes first, in four gated steps on
     the root track**, before any project code. They are separate steps
     because each is
     separately testable and because you must not build them all before
     I have seen any of them: a foundation delivered whole arrives with
     everything already written, and my first correction then costs the
     lot. Ordered by dependency — the tooling of `002` cites the
     boundary that `001` enforces, all of it runs under the harness of
     `000`, and `003` puts that same harness on the forge.
     **These four are one milestone, and it is drawn by what a working
     repository needs, not by cost class.** CI is the first step that
     leaves this machine, which is a reason for it to come *last within
     the foundation* — never a reason to move it out into a later
     milestone grouped by cost. I do not consider a project bootstrapped
     until its CI has run green.
     - **`step-000` — the harness, local only.** A `.gitignore` written
       with rule 5 in mind (local test state roots and volume
       directories; env files carrying test credentials; tool caches;
       game content downloaded outside an image build;
       `.claude/worktrees/`, which the current `.gitignore` already
       carries and which must survive the rewrite — a commit made
       while an agent worktree exists otherwise swallows its checkout;
       `.claude/reviews/`, which the
       reviewer templates assume is ignored — an untracked report
       otherwise blocks every clean-tree precondition downstream;
       `CLAUDE.local.md`); pinned base dependencies installable through
       one documented setup command; the check/test/verify harness of
       rule 2, built on the tools named there rather than on anything of
       your own — the harness *skeleton* and entry points, carrying at
       `000` only the families whose artifacts already exist (the
       governance documents, markdown/prose, JSON): Dockerfile lint,
       workflow validation and the rest join with their first
       artifact, per rule 2's never-ahead rule, so this step's green
       gate says nothing about files that are not there;
       **`check` in both of rule 2's scopes from the start** —
       the whole-tree gate as the default, and the narrowed
       what-changed form the development loop runs between gates, since
       every step after this one uses it — as **one entry point taking
       a scope, never a second recipe**: two recipes hold two lists of
       checks and will eventually differ in *what* they look for, not
       only in how much they look at; the same harness wired into the
       commit hooks, so the local runners never diverge; and the lint
       covering the
       governance documents themselves (the specifications, the plans,
       the rest), since in this repository documents are load-bearing.
       Its test: a fresh clone, the setup command, the check command,
       one commit — all green. **The CI workflow is deliberately not in
       this step** but in `003`: nothing local can exercise a workflow,
       and a tagged step must not carry an artifact its own gate never
       ran.
     - **`step-001` — the permission and hook baseline**, proposed for
       my review as a whole. Two layers, and the guard decides the
       shape of the settings rather than the other way round.
       **The guard first:** instantiate
       `.claude/spec-work/handoff/assets/bash_guard.py` as
       `.claude/hooks/bash_guard.py` (executable), read its module
       docstring in full, and edit only its `REGISTRY`. That docstring
       is the doctrine for this deliverable — how to choose between
       *rules* and *grants* per tool, what must land in
       `.claude/settings.json`, what the guard cannot see, and the rule
       that its `GIT` ground rules are the same in every project and are
       added to, never weakened. Inventory what this project actually
       runs — the harness, `docker` and its relatives, `steamcmd`
       invocations, `just`, `pre-commit`, `gh` — and give each tool in
       the registry the acts
       rule 9 gates for *this* project. The guard cannot see inside a
       `just` recipe — that is why rule 2's no-gated-act justfile
       invariant exists; record it here as a rule of the baseline,
       and keep the justfile honest to it whenever a recipe changes. Every rule you add gets a
       `CASES` entry: `--selftest` fails on a rule no case reaches,
       which is what keeps the intent executable rather than
       remembered.
       **Then the settings**, per the docstring's pairing: one broad
       allow per registry tool, no `ask` rule for anything the guard
       gates (a matching `ask` prompts even where the guard says allow,
       so it cancels every carve-out), no prefix rule restating a guard
       decision — a prefix is strictly weaker and gives you two sources
       of truth — and, as the **one deliberate exception to that**, a
       short `deny` backstop for the acts that cannot be undone: a hook
       fails open, and a prefix rule that binds without it is worth more
       than the duplication costs. Keep it short enough that the
       exception stays visible as one. Keep settings' `ask` tier for
       tools the guard has
       no registry entry for — `curl`, whatever this project
       reaches for outside it. **`git push` is not one of them**: it is
       gated in the guard's ground rules, and restating it as a prefix
       rule is the two-sources-of-truth case above, the weaker of which
       misses `git -C dir push`. What holds for a push wherever it is
       expressed is the *tier*: it asks and is never denied — a denied
       pattern cannot be approved in the very exchange rule 9 relies
       on. `deny` stays reserved for what has no authorised use at all,
       each named in the proposal.
       Auto memory is already off — keep it off.
       **A hook fails open**, so it is gated twice in this same step,
       and the two gates ask different questions.
       `bash_guard.py --liveness` goes in the pre-commit lint: the file
       is executable, the registry builds, every rule and grant is
       well-formed, a payload still comes back as a verdict — no
       behaviour cases, so a lint stays a lint, and the silent deaths
       (a syntax error from an edit, a lost `+x`, a rename) fail the
       commit. `bash_guard.py --selftest` goes in the *test* entry
       point: liveness, then every case, then coverage — a rule or
       grant no case reaches fails it. A guard that stops working must
       fail a gate, not fail quietly. And say plainly, in the proposal,
       what a dead guard
       would leave open — a broad allow plus a dead hook is a wider
       surface than a narrow allow list ever was, and the `deny`
       backstop exists exactly there.
       **Then measure, and write down what you measured.** Rule 2's
       probes for this step's mechanisms run here; their results land
       in a `.claude/docs/` file — every claim a measurement with the
       version it was taken on, the method, and a short re-measure
       recipe to re-run after a Claude Code update — plus a liveness
       check the session rituals of `002` can run: one command that
       must run silently, one the guard *grants*, and one it must
       **refuse, naming the rule that read it**. That third probe is
       the only one that says the hook is reached at all: if it merely
       prompts, the hook is not wired and the deny backstop is all that
       is left, while the guard's own `--selftest` and `--liveness`
       would still pass — they answer whether the file is correct, not
       whether anything calls it. For the same reason the governance
       family checks that the hook path in the settings resolves: a
       path naming a file that is not there leaves valid JSON, a
       settings file that loads, a green lint, and a guard that never
       runs. Report in the
       step summary what each mechanism actually did, including the
       ones that turned out to enforce nothing. Name the permission
       mode you expect me to work in — it is a committed setting
       (`permissions.defaultMode`), not only a per-session choice, and
       it decides how much the rest has to carry. **This prompt names
       no modes and asserts no mode behavior — deliberately**: the
       mode set and what each mode does to an unmatched command are
       properties of the installed version (modes exist that prompt,
       that auto-approve, and that judge by classifier and can deny
       outright — three different answers to what backs the guard's
       silence), so take the list from the running version and **probe
       the mode you propose**: what an unmatched command does under
       it, and **whether a hook `ask` still prompts** — recorded
       like the rest: the close ritual attempts its push in reliance on
       it, and a gate that has stopped gating says nothing about it.
       Set the mode rather than working
       around it — a mode that auto-accepts file edits is what removes
       the need for a blanket
       `Edit(/**)` allowance — and let it decide whether the
       mode-disabling keys belong in the baseline at all. Its test: my
       review of the proposal, the
       probe results, and `--selftest` green.
     - **`step-002` — the workflow tooling**, instantiated from
       `.claude/spec-work/handoff/assets/` per rule 3: `orient`,
       `resume-step`, `handover-step`, `approve-step`, the
       `step-reviewer` agent, and the agents whose trigger is a
       certainty of this plan (a milestone close needs its state review
       and its memory compaction to exist before it arrives, not to be
       improvised at the boundary). A recovery ritual created during the
       crisis it is needed for is too late. Propose the conditionally
       triggered rest only when their trigger exists — and an
       instantiated file must never name a skill or agent you did not
       adopt: trim the reference or adopt it, because a dangling name is
       a ritual that silently skips a step. One carve-out: a name that
       sits on `CLAUDE.md`'s not-yet-adopted list is not dangling — it
       is the documented fallback the milestone ritual relies on. Its
       test: I invoke each ritual and see it do what it claims —
       note that a new skill or agent may only be picked up at session
       start, so say whether a restart is part of the test.
     - **`step-003` — the same harness on the forge**, and the step
       that finishes the bootstrap. The workflow **reuses `000`'s entry
       points** rather than restating a single check — CI and the local
       runners must never be able to disagree about what "green" means
       — splits check and test into separate jobs once both exist,
       caches the toolchain, and keeps a way of proving a fresh setup
       still works. That proof may ride a scheduled job the
       specification already requires (root §8's refresh and update
       detection) rather than becoming a second scheduled workflow of
       its own — but none of those jobs can exist at this step, so
       until they do, CI's own per-run fresh setup (a clean checkout
       plus the documented setup command) is the proof, and the §8
       schedule takes the duty over when it arrives; do not invent a
       temporary schedule now. The forge is settled: GitHub (root §8,
       §2.8).
       This is the one foundation step
       nothing local can exercise, so **its gate is a real run**: name
       the remote and my authorisation of the first push as
       external prerequisites needed *at bootstrap* — not late, which is
       where a cost-ordered plan would put them — and treat the workflow
       as unverified until I authorise that push and the run comes back
       green. Its test: I authorise the push and watch the run.
     Nothing here is exempt from the small-step rule. If one of the
     four is still too big for a single test — or cut in the wrong
     place for this project — say so, and split it further in the plan
     you present; the cold review below is invited to find exactly that.
     And the four foundation entries carry this prompt's per-step
     prescriptions **in full** — the permission classifier and its
     traps, the probe duties, the CI reuse rule and its prerequisites,
     the instantiation list with rule 3's governance-placeholder
     semantics (resolve-at-invocation, and the close rituals keying on
     the just-closed step's track) — as their deliverables and test
     content:
     this prompt is consumed once at bootstrap, and a session resuming
     onto the plan must find that detail in the plan, not remember it.
   - Steps carry track-qualified identifiers per rule 6 — `step-000` to
     `step-003`, the foundation, onward on the root track; `step-pz-001`
     onward on the `pz` track — grouped under milestones or feature
     headings when the plan is big enough that grouping helps. The
     milestone close is what triggers rule 3's compaction and state
     review, and what makes those two agents' adoption certain at step
     `002`, so a plan you judge too small to group says so in the
     open-questions section rather than omitting the grouping silently.
     Steps must be small
     enough that I can test each one alone. For every step:
     **objective**, **spec sections implemented**, **deliverables**,
     **how I test it** — stating, when the test crosses rule 9's
     boundary, that it does, what it costs, and how I clean up
     afterwards — and **status** (`pending` / `in progress` /
     `awaiting test` / `done`).
     **An approved step keeps none of that.** On approval its entry is
     replaced, not annotated — the plan text described intentions the
     step itself has since changed, and it sits in a file every session
     reads at start. What is left is the heading and one bullet:

         ### <step id> — <step title> — `done`

         - **Outcome (approved YYYY-MM-DD, tag `<step id>`):** what now
           exists and what it decided, in a few lines, citing the
           decision entries it rests on. Detail in git history between
           tags `<previous step tag>` and `<step id>` — the previous
           tag is the `step-*` tag immediately before this one,
           whichever track it belongs to (rule 6).

     Carry it into `CLAUDE.md`'s plan conventions **as one line, not as
     this block** — a closed step keeps its heading marked `done` and
     one outcome bullet with the approval date, the tag, what now
     exists, and the tag range for the detail. That is enough to act on,
     which is what the early closes need: `/approve-step` is
     instantiated at step `002`, so the first two closes happen without
     it, and the first compacted entry is what every later close
     imitates.
   - Include the spec's non-code deliverables as steps in their own
     right: the per-image READMEs (each on its image's track), the
     repository README's content requirements, and the contributor
     guide for adding a game (both root-track; all root §9).
   - **The plans account for the whole specification**: every section
     of both documents appears in at least one step, or in a short
     explicit list of what
     this pass leaves out with the reason — root §10 (Future
     Considerations), root §11 (Non-Goals) and PZ §1's Build 41
     non-goal give you most
     of that list. An orphaned section is how a requirement gets lost.
     **Open facts are accounted for one by one**, each naming the step
     that settles it: they are the items the specification itself
     ordered resolved during implementation, so a section-level
     "verified along the way" leaves them owned by nobody — and the
     ones that go missing are the facts a section mentions in prose
     rather than lists (a size or cost "to be measured at
     implementation" is an open fact, whatever it is called where it
     appears — root §2.9 names several).
   - **Flag external prerequisites early**: things only I can prepare —
     the GitHub repository (created **public**: the project is a
     public product — root §1 — and root §2.8's idle-schedule
     behavior, which §8 defends against, is stated for public
     repositories), its remote, and my
     authorisation of the
     first push (needed at foundation step `003`); the GHCR owner
     namespace (root §7); the one-time per-package visibility flip at
     first publish, which only I can do (root §2.6, §8); and —
     conditionally — a registry credential if you resolve root §2.6's
     Docker Hub rate-limit risk via authenticated pulls. List each with
     the step that first needs it, so
     waiting on me never interrupts a step mid-flight.
   - End each plan with a section listing anything you consider
     underspecified, risky, or worth reordering — questions for me, never
     silent assumptions.
2. **The two decision logs** — root `DECISIONS.md` and
   `project-zomboid/DECISIONS.md`, initialised with the entry format;
   the root log's first entry records the adoption of this workflow.
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — one file, repository-wide: the ground rules above
   restated as your own standing
   instructions — concise, not verbatim, and keeping this numbering:
   tooling and decision entries cite the rules by number, and
   renumbering orphans every citation — plus the repository layout as
   it will emerge, the **track map** (each track's directory, step-id
   prefix, plan and log), a section headed exactly **`Current state`**
   (that
   wording — your tooling templates reference the section by name)
   **holding a closed list of item kinds and nothing else**: the
   current and next step, live world-state, open obligations, the
   pointers into `.claude/docs/`. What a closed step *produced* is not
   one of them — its outcome belongs in its plan entry and its tag, a
   durable fact in `.claude/docs/`, an invariant in the decision log —
   so the close ritual deletes that paragraph rather than demoting it.
   Say so here: without the closed list, each close adds one reasonable
   paragraph and the section becomes a changelog, which has been
   measured at 131 lines. And the session-start
   routine — including the standing instruction that a session resumed
   after an interruption, or told the work was interrupted, runs
   `/resume-step` before touching anything, never trusting the
   transcript, and — until step `002` has instantiated that skill —
   applies rule 3's re-orientation routine directly instead: the
   pointer to a not-yet-existing command must not strand the
   interruptions most likely to happen early, the ones during the
   foundation steps themselves. It also carries: the plan-step entry
   shape — the open form in full, the compacted-on-approval form as a
   single rule rather than a block, since the close ritual carries the
   detail and `CLAUDE.md` only states the invariant for the closes
   that precede it; the boundary-crossing-cost rule from the plan
   instructions above; and rule 3's governance-placeholder semantics —
   templates resolve the `{{PLAN}}`/`{{DECISIONS}}`/`{{SPEC}}`/
   `{{STEP_ID}}` set to the active track at invocation, except that
   close rituals key on the track of the step just closed, never on
   the already-advanced pointer. Later sessions extend the plans and
   close their steps from `CLAUDE.md` alone, and the bootstrap cold
   review sources those conventions from there, so they must actually
   be present.
   For as long as any tooling template remains un-instantiated
   it also carries the pointer to `.claude/spec-work/handoff/assets/`,
   rule 1's standing exception for that one directory, and the list of
   templates not yet adopted — a block deleted, together with the
   directory itself, once the last template is adopted or dropped
   (rule 3): after this session `CLAUDE.md`, not this prompt, is what a
   session reads, and a later milestone close that cannot find
   `optimize-memory` has no way to know it was ever offered. Kept
   deliberately small per rule 3: what applies always stays
   in, everything context-specific becomes a `.claude/docs/` file it
   points to — and it lands **with headroom, around 180 lines, not at
   the 220-line cap**, so the next session that must add a pointer adds
   it instead of reflowing the file first. Two things the restatement
   must not do, both observed: rule 9's enumeration is carried whole
   **including the qualifiers that bound its free side** — "installing
   pinned dependencies is free, fetching what is not pinned is not,
   with the three named exceptions" is
   one statement, and keeping half of it widens the boundary; and **no
   sentence may cite a clause the file does not contain** — a
   restatement that drops a clause and keeps the sentence referring to
   it leaves a rule that cannot be read at all. Write it so that a
   fresh session with no memory of this conversation behaves exactly as
   this one.
4. **`README.md`** — the neutral entry point for anyone who is not you: a
   human later, or another AI asked to review. Descriptive only: what the
   repository is, what each file is for, and the authority order —
   the specifications, then the decision logs, then the plans, then
   code. Include a short **For reviewers** section framing a review: the
   spec's
   must/should reading rules apply; code contradicting a *must* is a
   defect; a deviation from a *should* without a decision entry is
   a finding, while one with an entry is a judgement to assess; anything
   missing is checked against the owning track's plan's current step
   before being
   flagged; and a problem in the specification itself is a question for
   the human, never a change to propose. Note that each plan step's list
   of spec sections is the review checklist for that step.

Then, before presenting anything: **commit the six files** — one
`meta:` commit; rule 3's re-orientation reads git history, and an
uncommitted deliverable is invisible to it — and **have the plans
cold-reviewed**: this
session has no harness yet, so the cold review is rule 2's gate for it,
and step `000` brings these files under the harness retroactively.
Spawn a fresh-context, read-only subagent with an inline prompt (the
agent files come later, in step `002`) that reads only the two
specification documents
and the six files you have just written — never this conversation, and
nothing under `.claude/spec-work/`: it holds the specification phase's
history, this prompt included, and a reviewer that reads any of it is no
longer cold. (`.claude/refs/image-contract.md` is input, not
specification: the reviewer may read it but judges coverage against the
specification alone.) The workflow conventions its criteria cite — the
step
entry shape, boundary-crossing test costs, what counts as cheap — live
in the `CLAUDE.md` you have just written, not in the specification:
name it in the reviewer's prompt as the source of those conventions,
and tell the reviewer that `CLAUDE.md`'s pointer to
`.claude/spec-work/handoff/assets/` is out of bounds like the rest of
that directory. It audits the plans against the specification:

- **coverage** — every section of both documents mapped to a step or
  explicitly
  excluded with reason, verified section by section, not trusted; and
  **every open fact mapped to the step that settles it, item by item**
  — a section-level pointer ("verified across the later steps") is not
  a mapping, and the items that slip are the ones a section mentions in
  passing rather than lists;
- **ordering** — dependencies respected within each track and named
  across tracks, the cheap steps genuinely
  first, and no step depending on a capability a later step delivers
  (the classic: something goes live before its day-two operations
  exist);
- **granularity** — each step testable by me alone, boundary-crossing
  tests naming their cost and cleanup. **No step is exempt**, the
  foundation steps included: "this step is too big to judge in one
  gate" is one of the most valuable findings this review can return,
  and a plan that declares any step's breadth beyond question has
  disarmed its own reviewer;
- **proportion** — deliverables that exceed what their step's objective
  requires, anything the plan proposes to build that a standard tool of
  the ecosystem already provides, anything scheduled ahead of the need
  for it. "Delete this" and "use the boring existing tool" are findings
  of the same rank as a coverage gap;
- **prerequisites** — the external list complete, each with the step
  that first needs it;
- **consistency** — no dangling references between steps or between
  the two plans;
- **premises** — any factual claim in the plans the specification does
  not state is flagged for verification, never trusted: training
  knowledge goes stale.

One check the cold reviewer is structurally barred from — it may not
read this prompt — runs beside it: spawn a **second subagent,
deliberately not cold**, that reads only this prompt's foundation-step
prescriptions (`step-000`–`003` above) and the root plan, and reports
every prescription the four foundation entries dropped or weakened. It
judges transcription fidelity, nothing else — this prompt is consumed
once, and a dropped clause in the plan is invisible later, not wrong.
Its findings join the same triage.

Triage all findings — accept, reject with reason, or genuinely my
call — **apply and commit the accepted ones**, then present the triage
together with the corrected plans for discussion, rejected findings and
their reasons included. Step `000` begins only after I approve the plans.
