"""PreToolUse guard for Bash: gate commands that permission rules cannot express.

Template. Copy into a project as `.claude/hooks/bash_guard.py`, then edit only
the REGISTRY section near the bottom. Everything above it is meant to travel
between projects unchanged.

Permission patterns match a command prefix. That cannot express "a force push
however it is spelled" (`git push origin --force`), nor "safe only when a flag
is set" (`ansible-playbook site.yml --syntax-check`), because the deciding
token can sit anywhere and Claude tends to put it last.

Everything here is decided on *parsed* argv, one subcommand at a time. Matching
the raw line with regexes is unsound in both directions: `git commit -m 'fix
the --amend bug'` is not an amend, and in `ansible-playbook --syntax-check
a.yml && ansible-playbook deploy.yml` the safe half must not vouch for the
other. Only tokenizing resolves quoting; only splitting separates invocations.

A line can also hide a command inside another one. Assignments bind to what
runs next (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND=… git fetch`), wrappers run something else (`sudo
git push --force`), a shell's `-c` argument is a command line in its own right,
and a substitution or subshell is another command again — `echo $(git push
--force)`, and equally `git commit -m "$(git push --force)"`, where the quoting
hides it from the tokenizer entirely. Each is walked through to the command
underneath, and every command position found is judged — so gating a wrapper
never hides what it wraps.

Decisions: **deny** what has no authorized use, **ask** for anything that
writes outward or destroys work, stay silent otherwise. Silence is not approval
— it hands the call back to the permission rules and the current permission
mode, and what that mode then does with an unmatched command (prompt,
auto-approve, judge by classifier) is a property of the installed version,
probed at instantiation, never assumed from this docstring. There is also one
**allow**, which is the exception the next section is about.


WHERE THE GUARD GRANTS
----------------------

Almost nowhere, and the constraint is worth stating before the exception.

A hook's `"allow"` skips the interactive prompt — and measurement says it also
lifts two things the documentation does not mention: the bash safety
heuristics, and the **working-directory sandbox**. `touch ../escaped.txt`,
blocked outright when merely permitted by a rule, runs when a hook allows it.
So granting is not "approving a prompt on the operator's behalf"; it is
switching off the boundary that keeps a mistake inside the project. What it
cannot do is override a `deny` or `ask` rule from settings — those still hold,
which is why they, not this file, are the right place for anything that must
never happen.

That rules out the tempting general form, "if every command in the line is
silent, allow it". `touch "$(cat evil.txt)"` has nothing gated in it, and the
substitution's output becomes a path, which the guard never sees because it
does not exist until after the decision.

What remains is a grant keyed to a *shape whose output cannot direct a write*.
`git commit -m "$(…)"` qualifies: whatever comes back is a commit message.
That earns the one `Rule("allow", …)` in the registry, hedged three ways — it
ranks below deny and ask, it is withheld if anything else in the line has an
opinion, and `allow_globals` withholds it if any global option was used.

The reason it is worth having at all: Claude Code prompts on *any* line
containing a substitution, no permission rule can lift that, and the system
prompt pushes Claude toward writing them. Without the grant that prompt is
unavoidable and constant, which is how operators end up in a looser
permission mode — where
the sandbox is gone for everything, not just for one proven shape.

Before adding a second one, satisfy yourself that no expansion of the granted
command can become a path or a command. If it can, the answer is silence.


HOW A VERDICT IS REACHED
------------------------

Each command in a line is judged on its own, and the strongest verdict in the
line wins: deny, then ask, then allow, then silence. Within one invocation:

* a **Rule** that matches contributes its verdict — deny, ask or allow — and
  rules are consulted whether or not the tool declares grants;
* a **Grant** that matches contributes nothing: it is the absence of an
  objection, which is what silence means here;
* if nothing else applied, **`gated_verdict`** is contributed — the tool's
  answer for an invocation nothing matched;
* if that leaves nothing, the guard stays silent and the permission rules and
  the current mode decide.

`gated_verdict` set holds whether or not the tool declares grants, which is how
"everything here is the operator's" is said — a tool with no grants and
`gated_verdict="deny"` refuses every invocation, with its reason. Left unset it
derives: silent for a tool with no grants, `ask` for one that declares grants
and was not granted. So the common shapes need nothing: git and docker declare
rules and stay silent elsewhere; a deploy tool declares grants and asks
elsewhere; and a project that has decided unproven means refused says
`gated_verdict="deny"` once.

Two cases follow from that and are worth stating, because both look like holes
and neither is:

*Rules but no grants, and no rule matched* — silence. That is the safe-by-
default model working: the acts worth naming are named, everything else falls
through to the permission rules. git and docker are this shape.

*Neither rules nor grants* — silence, always. Such an entry exists for a
different job: it declares `nested`, so the guard can walk through it to the
command it runs, or it names aliases. Every shell wrapper is this shape.

`--liveness` checks the pair rather than the shape: a `gated_verdict` that is
not a real verdict, or one set with no `gated_reason` — a refusal that says
nothing is worse than none, since the reader cannot tell a rule from a bug.

A worked example, because the interaction is the part that misleads. With
`gated_verdict="deny"` and a grant on "any operand is a read verb", a deny
*rule* for write verbs looks redundant — a write-only command matches no grant
and is denied already, and `osmp server list && osmp server delete x` is
denied on its second invocation, since each is judged alone. It is not
redundant for one case: an operand that is a read verb without being a verb.

    openstack server delete list        # a server named "list"

The grant sees `list`, holds, and the command goes silent. Only a rule reading
"a write verb sits in this command" catches it. That is the whole of what such
a rule buys once judging is per-invocation, and it is worth its line where the
tool reaches real infrastructure.


CHOOSING A RULE KIND
--------------------

Put the enumeration on whichever side of the tool is finite, and let the
residue land on the safe default.

*Safe by default, with a listable set of dangerous acts* — git, docker, most
CLIs you read with. Declare `rules`. They are checked **existentially**: if any
subcommand in the line is a named act, the line is gated; everything unnamed
falls through silently, which is right because most of it is harmless.

*Dangerous by default, with a small safe set* — ansible-playbook, terraform,
kubectl, deploy scripts. Declare `grants`. They are checked **universally**:
every invocation must match a proven-safe shape, closed-world, and anything
else asks. A flag you never considered can then only move a verdict toward the
prompt, never away from it.

Getting this backwards is expensive both ways. Grants for git would mean
enumerating hundreds of safe subcommands, prompting on every one you forgot.
Rules for ansible would give you nowhere to put "unless --syntax-check", since
rules only fire — they never exempt.

A tool may declare both. Rules then hold regardless of the grants: a rule can
deny an act that a grant would otherwise have waved through.


WHAT MUST LAND IN settings.json
-------------------------------

This guard gates, and grants in exactly one place (see WHERE THE GUARD GRANTS).
It cannot loosen a `deny` or `ask` rule, so those remain yours alone. Pair it
accordingly:

1.  **Allow the tool broadly; let the guard claw back.** For every tool in the
    registry, add a broad allow — `Bash(git:*)`, and one line per tool the
    project adds. Prefix rules respect word boundaries, so `Bash(git:*)` does
    not leak to `git-crypt`. This is the whole point: broad allow plus a narrow
    hook is what replaces a long, brittle allow list. A gated tool with no
    allow line is pointless — it would prompt on everything anyway, and its
    grants would never be reached.

2.  **Never write an `ask` rule for a tool the guard gates.** Rules are
    evaluated deny → ask → allow, and a matching `ask` prompts *even when a
    hook returns "allow"*. An `ask Bash(ansible-playbook:*)` therefore makes
    every carve-out impossible, including the guard's. That mistake is the
    reason this file exists — express the exception here, in a `Grant`.

3.  **Do not restate the guard's asks in settings.** A prefix rule is strictly
    weaker: `Bash(git push:*)` misses `git -C dir push`, which the guard
    catches. Two sources of truth, one of them wrong.

4.  **Do keep a short `deny` backstop for the unrecoverable acts.** A hook that
    crashes — a syntax error from an edit, a lost `+x`, a missing python3 —
    fails *open*: Claude Code logs the failure and proceeds to the permission
    rules. The guard's own try/except cannot catch that, because the module
    never loaded. Denies are prefix-weak (they miss `git push origin --force`),
    but they cost nothing and they cover the losses you cannot undo.

    This need is created by step 1. Under a narrow allow list a dead guard only
    costs extra prompts; under `Bash(git:*)` it costs an unprompted
    `git push --force`. The broad allow and the deny list are a package.

5.  **Mind the permission mode.** In a mode that prompts on unmatched
    commands, the guard's silence is backed by a prompt; in a mode that
    suppresses or delegates that prompt, the guard's asks may be the only
    gate left — which is exactly when the grants carry real weight. The
    mode list and each mode's actual unmatched-command behavior belong to
    the installed version: probe and record them, never take them from
    this docstring.

A minimal pairing for the default registry, which carries git and docker.
Add one allow line per tool the project puts in the registry:

    "permissions": {
      "allow": [
        "Bash(git:*)",
        "Bash(docker:*)"
      ],
      "deny": [
        "Bash(git push --force:*)",
        "Bash(git push -f:*)",
        "Bash(git filter-branch:*)",
        "Bash(git reflog expire:*)"
      ]
    },
    "hooks": {
      "PreToolUse": [
        { "matcher": "Bash",
          "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
                       "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/bash_guard.py" } ] }
      ]
    }


CHANGING THE RULES
------------------

The registry is not ordinary code. It is the boundary the operator relies on,
so it does not move on the assistant's own judgement.

*The GIT tool is ground rules.* It is the same in every project by design, and
it encodes losses that are permanent or expensive to undo. Do not add, weaken
or remove a git rule to get past a prompt in front of you. Changing it needs a
reason specific to the project and stated out loud — "this repo has no remote,
so pushing cannot happen" is one; "the prompt was in my way" is not. If a git
rule fires and you believe it should not have, that is a case to report, not a
rule to edit.

*Every rule change is the operator's call.* Adding, modifying or deleting any
Rule, Grant, known_flag or tool — propose it, say what it would newly allow or
newly gate, and wait for the operator to agree. The one exception is creating
this file from the template at the start of a project: the operator reviews the
whole registry in a single pass then, so the initial set does not need to be
approved rule by rule.

*A surprise becomes a test.* When the operator reports that the guard did the
wrong thing — prompted on something harmless, stayed silent on something it
should have caught — the fix is not complete until CASES contains the exact
command they reported, asserting the corrected verdict. A rule change with no
reproduction case is a regression waiting to happen, and the report is the only
evidence of what the rule was actually for.


WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE
----------------------

The guard reads a command line; it does not run a shell. These are known and
accepted, listed so nobody mistakes silence for coverage.

*Nothing, for substitution.* It used to be listed here. An unquoted `$(…)`,
`<(…)` or `(…)` is split into its own tokens by the lexer and walked like any
other command; a quoted one — `-m "$(git push --force)"` — never reaches that
splitting, so it is read off the raw line instead, counting parentheses and
tracking single quotes. Double quotes and backticks run, so they are judged;
single quotes do not, so they are left alone. All of it is asserted in
ENGINE_CASES.

*A runner we do not recognise.* `myrunner git push --force` is silent, because
the first word is neither a registered tool, a known wrapper, nor a shell. The
fix is to add the runner to SHELL_WRAPPERS — deliberately, rather than by
guessing. An earlier version did guess, asking whenever a registered name
appeared anywhere in such a line, and it gated `ls ../docker`, `ls time` and
`cat docs/env`: a tool's name is also an ordinary word and an ordinary
directory. Narrowing it did not help, because the signal is absent rather than
weak. A known wrapper we cannot see past is a different case, with a real
signal behind it, and always asks.

*Program text in another language.* A shell's `-c` argument is re-examined;
`python3 -c` and `node -e` are not, since reading their argument as shell would
be guesswork.

*An argument made only of separator characters.* `git commit -m "&&"` splits
where the quoted `&&` sits, because posix tokenizing has already dropped the
quotes and the token is indistinguishable from the operator. It takes a
message that is *only* punctuation, so it has not seemed worth abandoning posix
mode over — but it is real.

*Handoff option arity is approximate.* `Nested.value_opts` covers the common
options; an unknown value-taking one makes the walk lose the command being run,
which asks. That direction is deliberate: a handoff we cannot follow is
unproven, not safe. The reverse — declaring a bare flag as value-taking — is
the one that loses something, since it skips a token too many and can step over
the command itself.


KEEPING IT HONEST
-----------------

This file is written at 88 columns and keeps them wherever it is vendored. A
project whose lint is narrower exempts the width rule for this path alone —
every other rule still applies — because reflowing it makes each refresh a
diff against your reformatting rather than against the template, and because
the formatter's answer here is worse: a nine-word set becomes eleven lines and
the comment explaining each dataclass field strands after a closing paren.
(With pre-commit, the exemption also needs `force-exclude`, since filenames
are passed explicitly.)

Because a broken guard fails open silently, it has to be gated twice, and the
two gates ask different questions.

`--liveness` asks *is this guard alive*: the file is executable, the registry
builds, every declared rule and grant is well-formed, and a payload on stdin
still comes back as a verdict. It runs no behaviour cases, so it stays a lint.
Wire it into whatever the project runs before a commit — that is where the
silent deaths happen: a syntax error from an edit, a lost `+x`, a rename.

`--selftest` asks *does this guard decide correctly*: liveness first, then
every case in CASES and ENGINE_CASES, then coverage — a rule or grant no case
reaches fails it. Wire that into the project's test entry point. Add a case
for every rule you add; that is the only place the intent is written down in
an executable form, and the coverage check is what makes it mandatory rather
than advisory.

Neither answers *is this guard reached*. A path in `settings.json` that names
a file which is not this one leaves valid JSON, a settings file that loads, a
green lint — and a guard that never runs. Nothing here can see that, so the
project checks the pointer itself (its governance well-formedness family is
the place) and probes it live: a command this guard refuses must come back
refused *by it*, naming the rule. If it merely prompts, the hook is not
reaching the tool call and only the deny backstop is left.

A project harness may also prove what CASES cannot. Cases are strings written
by hand; a harness can derive them — every playbook under an exempt directory
must be silent, every one outside it gated, so a file added tomorrow is judged
tomorrow without anyone remembering. Derive what only the project can derive,
and leave the rest here: a case about how a command line is read belongs in
ENGINE_CASES, one about a tool's verdicts in CASES, and duplicating either in
a harness means two places to update and one of them silently wrong.

    one of them is present, wherever it sits — and `None` means the path alone
    is the act, no flag needed.

        Proven-safe shapes, checked universally: an invocation is silent only

        apply; an empty tuple means gated with nothing declared safe, so every

        tool's flag list — it is the set you have decided is safe to see, so

    `aliases`
        Other binary names that behave identically — `podman` for `docker`,
        `nerdctl` for both. The registry indexes the tool under each, so a
        drop-in replacement needs no second entry to keep in step.

        judging the outer command never hides the inner one — both are judged,
        strongest verdict wins.

    `known_env`
        The same closed world for `FOO=bar` assignments written before the
        command. An unlisted assignment leaves a gated invocation unproven, so
        a project whose tool takes none can leave this empty and every
        assignment will prompt. Unused when the tool is not gated — a tool that
        is safe by default gates assignments through `Rule.env` instead.

    `value_flags`
        Flags that consume the following token — the tool's arity, which the
        parser cannot guess. Declaring `-i` is what makes `ansible-playbook
        deploy.yml -i --syntax-check` read as "inventory is the string
        --syntax-check", still a real deploy; undeclared, `--syntax-check`
        would look operative and the deploy would pass as a parse-only run. It
        also puts the value within reach of `Grant.flag_values`. Under-
        declaring is unsafe; over-declaring merely swallows an operand, so
        declare every value-taking flag you list in `known_flags`.

    `global_value_opts` / `global_bare_opts`
        Options accepted *before* the subcommand, stripped so that the
        subcommand path lands where `Rule.path` and `Grant.path` expect it.
        Undeclared, `git -C dir push` parses to operands ("dir", "push"), no
        rule for ("push",) matches, and the push goes ungated. `_value_` opts
        consume the next token (`-C dir`, or `--git-dir=x` in one token);
        `_bare_` opts stand alone (`--no-pager`). What separates these from
        `value_flags` is position: they are recognized only ahead of the
        subcommand, and never gate anything themselves.

# everything to say about what comes next. They come first because everything
# below is judged through them: `sudo git push --force` is a git push.
#
# Unlike the tools that follow, this list is not project policy — how a shell
# hides a command is the same everywhere — so it is the one part of the
# registry that usually travels between projects unchanged. Add to it when a
# project uses a runner that is not here; a missing entry is a silent hole,

# --- docker: it runs other programs, so the guard follows through ----------
# Safe by default with a listable set of dangerous acts, so `rules`. The three

# nothing in one that does not — the rules simply never fire. A project adds its
# own beside them; it does not need to invent these.
#
# All four forms have the same shape — options, then one operand the form keeps
# for itself, then the command — and differ only in which options take a value:

#   compose run SERVICE [cmd]  spawns one from a compose service
#   exec CONTAINER cmd         uses a container already running
#   compose exec SERVICE cmd   same, by service
#
# What is gated is the command run *in* the container. The image or service is
# deliberately not read as a program, even when it is named after one: an image
# called `org/git` may or may not entrypoint into git, and guessing from the
# name would gate `docker run org/rm -rf` as an `rm` on the host.
#
# Only genuinely value-taking options are listed — over-declaring one would
# skip a token too many and could step over the command itself.
#
# A command inside a container is not always the host's: `docker run --rm
# alpine git push` cannot reach this repo, while `-v $(pwd):/r` can. The guard
# cannot tell those apart, and gates both.

# --- test fixture: a tool that does not exist ------------------------------
# `stubtool` is not in TOOLS and is not a real program. It exists so the engine
# can be tested on its own terms: how a command line is cut up, how flags are
# parsed, how verdicts rank. Doing that through a registry tool would tie the
# engine's tests to rules that legitimately change per project — trimming a git
# rule should never break a test about newline handling.
#
# It declares everything the engine can express, so nothing is tested by
# accident: rules and grants together, a deny and an ask on the same path, a
# value-taking flag, a closed-world flag set. Its shape is modelled on a deploy
# tool that is dangerous by default and safe only when it parses instead of
# applying — the pattern a real terraform, kubectl or ansible-playbook entry
# would follow — but it is a fixture, not a config to copy verbatim.
