description: Pre-test handover sequence — run when the current step's
  implementation is complete and ready for operator testing, or when the
  operator asks for the handover. Checks, staleness sweep, review, then
  hand the step to the operator.

> repository's rule-2 harness entry points (e.g. `make verify`,
> `npm run check`, `rake test`).
> Frontmatter carries `name` and `description` only, deliberately: a

**When to use.** When the step is implemented and ready for the
operator's manual test, or when they ask for the handover. The
post-approval close is `/approve-step`, not this.

Hand the current step over for operator testing. In order:

1. **Checks green:** run `{{VERIFY_COMMAND}}` (the verification rule:
   the check and the test halves both pass); fix until it does. If the
   step added artifacts the harness should cover, confirm it actually
   covers them — a check that never ran is not green.
2. **Staleness sweep (the same-commit rule):** update in the same
   commit(s) as the
   work everything the step made stale — `{{PLAN}}` step status (to
   `awaiting test`) and any renumber references, `CLAUDE.md`'s
   current-step pointer and file map, `README.md`'s map, `docs/`
   deliverables, `{{DECISIONS}}` entries, and any `.claude/docs/`
   lesson worth keeping for future sessions.
3. **Review:** run the `step-reviewer` agent over the step's diff
   (last `step-*` tag → HEAD). The diff shows committed work only, so
   the step's work and the sweep must be in commits before it runs.
   Address or explicitly rebut each finding before handover.
4. **Tree clean:** everything above — the step's work, the sweep, the
   review fixes — is already in small, coherent commits with
   `{{STEP_ID}}:` subjects (committed as the work happened, not batched
   here); `git status` shows nothing pending. No catch-all closing
   commit. Never push.
5. **Handover message:** (a) short summary of what the step did;
   (b) precise manual test instructions — exact commands and what the
   operator should observe, including cost and cleanup if the test
   crosses the action boundary; (c) state that you are waiting for
   the operator's verdict. Do not begin the next step.
