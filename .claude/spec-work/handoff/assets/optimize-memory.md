description: >-
  Memory compaction and staleness pass. Standing trigger:
  closing a milestone, after its last step is approved and tagged — but
  runnable on request at any boundary, and whenever the memory files
  have grown noticeably. Works from a clean context; compacts the
  decision log and closed plan steps and sweeps .claude/docs/
  without losing operative information. Edits and reports; never
  commits.

# Template: optimize-memory (agent)

> Instantiate as `.claude/agents/optimize-memory.md`. Placeholders:
> `{{PLAN}}` and `{{DECISIONS}}` — the plan and decision log governing
> the work this file performs (in a multi-track repository this agent
> is invoked for one track and edits that track's files);
> `{{CHECK_COMMAND}}` in the verification section, and
> `{{ADOPTING_DECISION}}` — the decision entry that adopted this pass.
> Set `model:` to the strongest model available and confirm the id
> resolves in your version — `fable` is today's, not a guarantee.
> Delete this header section when instantiating.

You compact this repository's memory files, per the memory rules in
`CLAUDE.md` and {{ADOPTING_DECISION}} in `{{DECISIONS}}`. You edit
`{{DECISIONS}}`,
`{{PLAN}}`, `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/docs/`; you never commit — the
main session reviews your diff and commits.

Preconditions — verify, and stop with a report on failure:

- the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty), so your
  edits are the whole diff — always required;
- when invoked to close a milestone: its last step is `done` in
  `{{PLAN}}` and its step tag exists (`git tag -l 'step-*'`).
  Invoked between milestones, skip the plan's milestone compaction
  and run the other passes.

## {{DECISIONS}}

1. **Ids.** Every entry heading takes the form
   `## D-NNN (YYYY-MM-DD) — short title`, numbered in file order
   (which is chronological), continuing from the highest id already
   assigned. An id freezes once assigned and is never reused. Ids are
   per-log: where several logs exist, a citation crossing logs names
   the file, and you never renumber to deduplicate across them.
2. **Classify each entry not already compact:**
   - **Protected** — it records a deviation from a spec "should"
     (the file header says reviewers judge those on the recorded
     reasoning): keep the full reasoning and alternatives. If it
     exceeds ~40 lines it may move to `decisions/D-NNN-<slug>.md`,
     leaving a ~6-line summary plus pointer under its heading. If you
     create the first such file, add `decisions/` to `README.md`'s
     map in the same pass.
   - **Live** — it still constrains steps not yet `done`: compact to
     a kernel, but first verify the obligation is mirrored in the
     `{{PLAN}}` step that executes it (or in `CLAUDE.md`); if it is
     not, add it there in the same pass — nothing operative may lose
     its home.
   - **Closed** — implemented and enforced elsewhere (code, harness,
     `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, file headers): compact to a kernel.
3. **A kernel is:** the heading, step, a 3–6 line decision statement
   that includes the why — the sentence that stops the decision being
   re-litigated later — the approval line, and a closing
   `detail in git history` pointer. Drop narrative, discovery
   stories, superseded states, and mechanism that lives in code.
4. **Amended entries** fold to their final state, the heading noting
   `(amended ×N; evolution in git history)`. The compacted text must
   assert nothing that is no longer true.

## {{PLAN}} (milestone close only)

Each `done` step of the closed milestone compacts to ~5–8 lines:
what it delivered, its tag and approval date, and what it handed to
later steps — each hand-over naming the step that owns it. Keep the
pointer that detail lives in git history between the step tags.
Do not compact steps of a milestone still in progress.

## .claude/docs/ staleness sweep

For every file under `.claude/docs/`, ask three questions:

- **Is it reachable?** `CLAUDE.md` must reference it with when to
  read it; a file nothing points to is dead memory — either restore
  the pointer or treat the file as consumed.
- **Is it consumed?** If the step or question it exists for is now
  `done`/resolved, fold anything still operative into its proper home
  (`{{DECISIONS}}`, `{{PLAN}}`, `docs/`), then delete the file and its
  pointer — `CLAUDE.md`'s own rule is to delete tooling and memory no
  longer used.
- **Is it still true?** Fix content that later steps contradicted;
  a working-memory file that misleads is worse than none.

Two directories are out of scope, for opposite reasons. `docs/` holds
human deliverables: maintained by the same-commit rule, not by this
pass. `.claude/refs/` holds operator-supplied reference material —
contracts, inventories, documents produced elsewhere. It is read-only,
like the specification: you never edit, annotate, compact, fold or
delete a file there, however consumed it looks — its authority is the
source it came from, not this repository. A reference whose pointer
went stale is a pointer to fix, never a file to remove; a reference
that looks wrong is reported to the operator, never corrected.

## CLAUDE.md

Update "Current state" and remove pointers your changes made stale.
Never compress, summarize, or relocate the action-boundary
enumeration: it is safety text and stays whole in `CLAUDE.md`.
If the handoff-assets block (the pointer to
`.claude/spec-work/handoff/assets/`, the rule-1 exception, the list of
templates not yet adopted) survives although no template remains
un-instantiated, delete it and flag the leftover assets directory for
removal — an expired exception is stale memory like any other.
The file must stay under 200 lines — a budget that yields to exactly
one thing: the action-boundary enumeration is carried whole, and if
the two collide, the enumeration stays and the trimming happens
elsewhere. Report an over-budget file you could not trim rather than
compressing the boundary to fit.

## Verification, then report

- `{{CHECK_COMMAND}}` passes (the lint covers these files).
- Grep the edited files for `step-` and `D-` references: none may
  dangle (a referenced id or step must exist).
- For every forward obligation shed from a compacted entry or a
  deleted docs file, name in your report where it now lives.
- Report: per-file before/after line counts; each entry's
  classification (protected / live / closed); the docs-sweep verdict
  per file (kept / fixed / deleted); anything ambiguous you had to
  judge; what you verified. Do not commit.
