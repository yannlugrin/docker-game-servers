# git, just, and python3 (>= 3.9) with its `venv` module. Everything
# else arrives through `just setup`.

# Nothing here holds its own list of checks. Both scopes of `check` and
# the git pre-commit hook all read `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, so they
# can differ in how much of the tree they look at and never in what
# they look for.
#
# A failing `check` can modify the working tree: three of the hooks
# repair rather than report (D-006). A passing one never writes.
#
# Only the single comment line directly above a recipe reaches
# `just --list`; anything longer belongs in the recipe body.
